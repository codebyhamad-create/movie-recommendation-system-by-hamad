A content-based movie recommendation system using Streamlit and the TMDB 5000 Dataset.

## Note on Model Files
The `similarity.pkl` file is too large for GitHub (180MB). 

**To run this project locally:**
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run the `data preprocessing.ipynb` notebook once. 
3. This will generate the `similarity.pkl` file in your folder.
4. Run the app: `streamlit run app.py`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
